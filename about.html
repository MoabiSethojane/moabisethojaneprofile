   This is the autobiography of Moabi Sethojane , 1998 was my first primary academic year
   and I completed my primay in 2004 moving to my high school that is where i faced some challenges and became the solver of some of them. The first challenge,<br> was the modules that i was doing which were English, Mathematics, Science, Business Entrepreneurship,Sesotho which is my home languege,Basic handcraft computer literecy and Religious studies because the school is a roman catholic church.

    Another challenge I faced was interact with the computer my first time, the <br>likes of using a mouse and understaning how the computer works and its purpose were big challenge to me the unfortunate part was that I had to do computer literecy for three years which<br> my secondary level. In high school I did Mathematic, Biology, English , English literature, Bible studies, Commerce,Principles of Accounting, English and Sesotho. Even though I was not doing computer classes anymore i had one more chance of interacting with computers after my grade 12 that was during my education gap year, because of the knowledge I had acquired for that volunteer program I enroll with Vaal univesity of Technology.<br>
